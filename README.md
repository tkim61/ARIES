# ARIES
Files for the ARIES project at Brown University
The Arduino folder contains all the arduino files
This project is intended to be run with an ESP32 chip connected to a raspberry pi zero W
Arduino IDE was used to write all the arduino files that run on the ESP32.
The board was set up with a ESP32-DEV board manager, at a 11920 baud rate.
Code is modified and influenced by sources including, but not limited to:
RandomNerd Tutorials, Arduino default libraries, and Dronebot Workshop.
Please also see abhaykulkarni/aries, though most of that code should be here as well.
